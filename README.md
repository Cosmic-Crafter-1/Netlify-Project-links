Netlify links to my projects that I can keep track of: 

Greetings, Hope you are doing well.
I've chosen Front end development because I love building a massive value product one step at a time, just like LEGO.
I try to spot few everyday common problems, then observe, learn, adapt, improvise and finally build a solution to it, like a web-app(named purrfect pantry) that helps me remember my list of groceries or my to-do tasks using JavaScript, and Firebase primarily. (Link: https://purrfect-pantry.netlify.app/ )
The work I'm really proud of is to have built a professional looking responsive Price Plan Page for a company wherein I had to learn product psychology, consumer psychology (of India and her people), habit forming decisions to drive more sales and to implement the website , and also simultaneously keeping it unique and fresh.

My completed / recently revised projects include : 
1. A web-app(named purrfect pantry) that helps me remember my list of groceries or my tasks using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. (Link: https://purrfect-pantry.netlify.app/ )
2. Built a chrome extension which can help people to keep track of their most important leads for sales and marketing in LinkedIn. (Have to manually upload into your current extensions , Link: https://github.com/Cosmic-Crafter-1/leadsTracker )
3. A highly complex (12-18 length) password generator created because I was curious and wanted my own generator.  (Link : https://highly-complex-password-generator.netlify.app/ )
4. Pumpkin purrfect meme picker which helps a user choose a cat meme based on their current emotions to help them soothe. (Link: https://pumpkin-perfect-meme-picker.netlify.app/ )
5. Etch-a-sketch: An online sketchpad to showcase your creativity and draw what you need. ( https://vishnu-etch-a-sketch.netlify.app/ )
6. A pathway portal webpage for health service providers to help users choose from. (Link: https://sculpt-excellence.netlify.app/#pathway-portals )

My medium term projects that I'm learning as well as implementing (soon to be finished) include: 
1. Adventure with Elara, an interactive and engaging book for kids.
2. An AirBnb experiences clone using React JS.
3. VanLife: A react application to hire a camper van with over 10+ routes, filter by van type, login system for protected routes, Firebase for database and Figma for design inpirations.

My Long term goals and projects include: 
1. UniExchange (in progress) : A full fledged website / platform for helping university students to exhange items not needed by them or that don't serve them long term.
2. Virtual World with Self Driving Cars (in progress): A world where A.I. cars actually follow traffic rules, don't crash into obstacles and follow the route you set or CREATE !! Works by combining deep learning, web development and neural networks. (Being made using pure vanilla javascript.)

Thank you for going through the entirety.
